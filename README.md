# IntroductionToProgrammingWithMATLAB

All problems from a massive online open course named as 'Introduction to Programming with MATLAB' by Vandebilt University and
offered through coursera.

This repository includes my solutions as well as solution from course instructor. 

Warning: If you are taking this course and you are here because of Google search result please do not copy codes from here to your
course. If you do that you are going to learn nothing. Trust me: Programming is fun enough,it may needs time but in the end it is
worth of giving much time. My personal experience: This is my first course to the era of programming,before that i do not know what
programming is. I learnt tonnes about programming and MATLAB.
